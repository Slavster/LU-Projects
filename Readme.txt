Hello, and welcome to Slav’s Github Python Portfolio!

Better Dungeon Game.py
This a fun little dungeon crawler game where your objective is to find the secret door in the maze while also avoiding the monster.

draft.py
This is my March Madness draft manager program. Given a number of players, it will assign random numbers to them for each round and let players pick a team each round. Any teams that were not chosen get sent to a bonus round at the end of the game. The current setup of the game isn associated “tier_X_teams.txt” files is for the 2017 season.
